# Project Description #
    I want to take an animation and have this script pull a frame from the animation 
    depending on the time of the day, and then update my twitter avatar.

# Approach #
    [x] Write a node script that will update my twitter avatar
    [x] Update script to update my avatar every X hours

# Ideas #
    [] Write separate script to pull a frame down from an animation, encode as base64
            Was thinking this script should pull a frame depending on time of day
    [] Update Node Script to take teh animation frame and update twitter profile with it
    [] Host this script somewhere so that my twitter avatar updates in the background
    [] The NFT project
    [] Create a script that generates like 10,000 animation variations - the same way 
        current NFT projects do it with images.
    [] Give nft owners access to this node script
            The Problem is that in order to leverage that new twitter feature, each frame 
            would have to minted in some fashion. You'd probably have to pre-render the frames
            and mint them, and then have the script somehow access these frames. I doubt the API
            to play with the NFTs would be available any time soon.
